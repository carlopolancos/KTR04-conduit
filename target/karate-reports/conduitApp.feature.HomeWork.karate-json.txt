It answers critical questions: Have you grasped everything correctly? Is there anything you've missed? Are you prepared for the next lesson? These assessments ensure that you build a solid foundation of knowledge, confidently and efficiently paving the way for swift progress and effective learning outcomes.\",\"body\":\"Traditional educational institutions, such as colleges and universities, commonly use tests and assessments to measure knowledge. This approach is effective for gauging student performance, but it's not without drawbacks. In these settings, assessments after every lecture aren't feasible due to the time required for teachers to evaluate them. This often leads to students having a false sense of understanding, believing they've comprehended all aspects of a lecture when, in reality, small but crucial details might be missed. These 'knowledge gaps' can accumulate, making more complex topics difficult to grasp later on.\\n\\nAt Bondar Academy, we address this challenge by implementing self-assessments after every lecture. These are designed to cover key questions that ensure a thorough understanding of the material, essential for comfort and success in future lectures. The number of questions varies, ranging from 3-4 to 15-20, depending on the lecture's significance and the volume of critical information. With these self-assessments, students receive immediate feedback, helping them determine if they've fully understood the lecture or if they need to revisit certain parts or seek assistance from our instructors in the Slack Workspace.\",\"tagList\":[\"Self-Assessment\",\"Test\",\"Exam\"],\"createdAt\":\"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z\",\"updatedAt\":\"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z\",\"favorited\":false,\"favoritesCount\":224,\"author\":{\"username\":\"Artem Bondar\",\"bio\":null,\"image\":\"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/bondar-academy-visuals\/Android.png\",\"following\":false}},{\"slug\":\"Practical-Implementation-of-Skills:-Homework-Assignments-with-Instructor-Supervision-1\",\"title\":\"Practical Implementation of Skills: Homework Assignments with Instructor Supervision\",\"description\":\"Knowledge or skills not reinforced through practical exercises can quickly fade, often faster than anticipated.

The key to mastering these skills lies in writing code; the more you write, the better you become. However, merely replicating code seen in lectures leads to minimal learning. Often, this approach leaves students unclear about why their code works the way it does, as they focus on copying rather than understanding.\\n\\nA homework assignment at Bondar Academy starts with a blank page, challenging students to apply all their knowledge to write the first line of code. This process is more demanding than it appears. As you write each line, understanding and reasoning grow, making your code meaningful and comprehensible.

It answers critical questions: Have you grasped everything correctly? Is there anything you've missed? Are you prepared for the next lesson? These assessments ensure that you build a solid foundation of knowledge, confidently and efficiently paving the way for swift progress and effective learning outcomes.\",\"body\":\"Traditional educational institutions, such as colleges and universities, commonly use tests and assessments to measure knowledge. This approach is effective for gauging student performance, but it's not without drawbacks. In these settings, assessments after every lecture aren't feasible due to the time required for teachers to evaluate them. This often leads to students having a false sense of understanding, believing they've comprehended all aspects of a lecture when, in reality, small but crucial details might be missed. These 'knowledge gaps' can accumulate, making more complex topics difficult to grasp later on.\\n\\nAt Bondar Academy, we address this challenge by implementing self-assessments after every lecture. These are designed to cover key questions that ensure a thorough understanding of the material, essential for comfort and success in future lectures. The number of questions varies, ranging from 3-4 to 15-20, depending on the lecture's significance and the volume of critical information. With these self-assessments, students receive immediate feedback, helping them determine if they've fully understood the lecture or if they need to revisit certain parts or seek assistance from our instructors in the Slack Workspace.\",\"tagList\":[\"Self-Assessment\",\"Test\",\"Exam\"],\"createdAt\":\"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z\",\"updatedAt\":\"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z\",\"favorited\":false,\"favoritesCount\":224,\"author\":{\"username\":\"Artem Bondar\",\"bio\":null,\"image\":\"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/bondar-academy-visuals\/Android.png\",\"following\":false}},{\"slug\":\"Practical-Implementation-of-Skills:-Homework-Assignments-with-Instructor-Supervision-1\",\"title\":\"Practical Implementation of Skills: Homework Assignments with Instructor Supervision\",\"description\":\"Knowledge or skills not reinforced through practical exercises can quickly fade, often faster than anticipated.

At Bondar Academy, we ensure this vital step by assigning homework, rigorously evaluating the outcomes, and providing valuable feedback to guide your learning journey.\",\"body\":\"Homework assignments are a fundamental component of the educational methodology at Bondar Academy, especially in technical education where learning a new programming language or framework is involved. The key to mastering these skills lies in writing code; the more you write, the better you become. However, merely replicating code seen in lectures leads to minimal learning. Often, this approach leaves students unclear about why their code works the way it does, as they focus on copying rather than understanding.\\n\\nA homework assignment at Bondar Academy starts with a blank page, challenging students to apply all their knowledge to write the first line of code. This process is more demanding than it appears. As you write each line, understanding and reasoning grow, making your code meaningful and comprehensible.
